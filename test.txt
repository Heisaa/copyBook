Designers are already offering interfaces that are wearable or control implanted (under-the-skin) devices, such as pacemakers, insulin pumps, and varied bio- monitors. Other kinds of sensors already track FedEx packages, users entering buildings, or cars at tollbootl1s, but they will expand into elaborate sensor 11ets th at follow crowds, epidemics, and pollution. Other designers promote persuasive technologies that change users' behav- ior, multi-modal or gestural interfaces that facilitate use, and affective interfaces that respond to the user's emotional state. We are living in an exciting time for designers of user interfaces. The inspira- tional pronouncements from technology prophets can be thrilling, but rapid progress is more likely to come from those who do the hard work of tuning designs to ge11uine human needs. These designers will rigorously evaluate actu al use with eager early adopters, as well as reluctant late adopters, and seri- ously study the resistant non-users. This book's authors believe that the next phase of human-computer interaction will be strongly influenced by those who are devoted to broadening th e community of users by promoting universal usability and facilitating many forms of social media participation. User inter- faces that deliver excellent user experiences will be a key component in improv - ing healthcare, creating sustainable economies, protecting natural resources, and resolving conflicts (Froeh lich et al., 2010; Friedman et al., 2014). This first chap ter gives a broad overview of human-computer interaction from practitioners' and researchers' perspectives. It lays out usability goals, measures, and motivations in Sections 1.2 and 1.3 and closes with a statement of goals for our profession. Specific references cited in the chapter appear at the end, followed by a set of general references. Lists of relevant books, guidelines documents, journals, professional organizations, and video collections give readers starting points for further study. One 11ext 11 2011 spe11d spa11.
